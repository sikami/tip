File Writing

 PrintWriter class offers the functionality to write to files.

-contoh: 

PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter("file.txt");
writer.println("Hello file!"); //writes the string "Hello file!" and line change to the file
writer.println("More text");
writer.print("And a little extra"); // writes the string "And a little extra" to the file without a line change
writer.close(); //closes the file and ensures that the written text is saved to the file


- di konstructor harus ada throws exception
-contoh:

public class Storer {

    public void writeToFile(String fileName, String text) throws Exception {
        PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(fileName);
        writer.println(text);
        writer.close();
    }
}
